 * The most important class in our API is the controller which acts as the

 * which exposes some services and is accessed via specific url (/payment).

 * #RestController: this annotation marks the class as a Resource, it defines implicitly
 * both #Controller and #ResponseBody mvc annotations, when annotating a class with
 * #RestController, itâ€™s not necessary to write #ResponseBody beside the POJO classes
 * returned from your methods.
 * <p>
 * #RequestMapping: this annotation defines the url of the resource in addition to the method
 * type: GET/POST, in our example we expose the payment service as POST which is accessed
 * through /payment/pay.
